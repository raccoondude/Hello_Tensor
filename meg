The first horror movie I ever saw was “Jaws”–an all-time classic filmed in 1975 by Steven Spielberg. My parents did not let me watch “Alien,” “Friday 13,” or any other cult thrillers, so I desperately wanted to see one. Kids in my class were bragging about watching this or that scary movie, and I remember envying them greatly. One day when my parents were out, and I was staying home, lazily clicking the TV remote, when all of a sudden a huge maw with razor-sharp teeth almost jumped out of the screen. It was already the middle of the movie and I did not get all the premise, but I still watched it till the end. Next day, I could finally boast of watching a horror film.“Jaws” still evokes warm memories in me. This is why I was disappointed with the sequels: they could never recreate the feeling of imminent danger lurking beneath the sea surface. Besides, they were worse than the original in almost every aspect. Long story short, I like movies about sharks. I also like sharks in general, but even more than that, I admire prehistoric gigantic sharks: megalodons. So, when I saw trailers of “The Meg,” I knew what I wainted to watch.
